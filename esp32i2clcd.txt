//You will need an updated I2C LCD library, the original one I couldn't get to work but this one does seem to work - http://www.esp32learning.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LiquidCrystal_I2C-master.zip 
//You will need to import this into the IDE as usual 
//Now my example below required the I2C address to be changed to 0x3F, a lot of the examples I have looked at are set to 0x27 


#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x3F,16,2); // set the LCD address to 0x3F for a 16 chars and 2 line display

void setup()
{
lcd.init(); // initialize the lcd
lcd.init();
// Print a message to the LCD.
lcd.backlight();
lcd.setCursor(0,0);
lcd.print("Hello world");
lcd.setCursor(1,0);
lcd.print("ESP32 I2C LCD");

}

void loop()
